# Outlier-detection
Outlier handling techniques in acoustic signals for marine applications

This project analyses and implements three different strategies for outlier management with particular reference to underwater acoustic signals in USBL (ultra short base line) systems.

Two unsupervised robust outlier handling methods are described: least entropy like(LEL) and Norm-1 minimization, and a supervised outlier rejection method based on Quantile regression.
